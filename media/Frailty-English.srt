1
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,417
What's that ambulance
doing out there?

2
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,295
I don't know. I'll check it out.

3
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,270
- Evening, sir.
- How's it going, Griff?

4
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,023
I can't complain and won't.

5
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,608
- That him?
- Yep.

6
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,194
Might just be some crackpot,
but I figured I should call you anyway.

7
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,739
- Did he ask for me by name?
- Nope.

8
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,325
Asked for the agent in charge
of the God's Hand case.

9
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,784
Said he had important info.

10
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,661
- Didn't say what?
- Nope.

11
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,205
Said he'd only talk to you.

12
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,714
You the agent in charge
of the God's Hand case?

13
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,426
That's right. Wesley Doyle.

14
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,304
That's a picture of
you and your mother, huh?

15
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,975
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
take things off of my desk.

16
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:32,104
I'm sorry about that.
Guess I've been in here a while.

17
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,651
Already had a look at all
your plaques and your citations.

18
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,528
Didn't really care
to have a look at those.

19
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,996
So, what can I do for you, Mr...?

20
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,708
Meiks. Name's Fenton Meiks.

21
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,338
Now, listen, this may sound
a little bit crazy, but...

22
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,842
I know who the God's Hand killer is.

23
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,762
All right, I'll bite.

24
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,181
Who?

25
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,018
You haven't even heard me out yet
and already you doubt me.

26
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,021
Why is that?

27
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,649
Because in a case like this...

28
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,402
nobody just walks in
and tells you who the killer is.

29
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,696
It just doesn't happen that way.

30
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,533
Sometimes truth defies reason,
Agent Doyle.

31
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,076
Yeah?

32
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,452
So who is it, then?

33
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,998
My brother.

34
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,792
What makes you think that?

35
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,879
I got a call from him.

36
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,048
Last night.

37
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,720
I wonder where he could be,
I'm getting worried.

38
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,471
Are you, darling? What about?

39
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,223
Hello?

40
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,769
- Hello?
- Demons are taking over the world.

41
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,396
To be going on a honeymoon...

42
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,856
Adam?

43
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,733
I can't destroy them all.

44
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,027
They're everywhere.
I can't take it anymore.

45
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,903
Now, let's talk about this, Adam.

46
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,574
Look, there's nothing to talk about.
It's over.

47
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,703
Whatever happens, you have to take me
to the rose garden.

48
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,747
You promised. Remember?

49
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,999
- Now, sit still, listen to... Adam.
- Remember?

50
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,334
Remember, you promised.

51
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,455
Meat?

52
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,791
That's where all this took place.

53
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,960
It's about 200 miles west of here,
just north of Abilene.

54
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,421
Now, why'd you go to Thurman?

55
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,424
To bury Adam in the rose garden.

56
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,967
Why would you do that?

57
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,930
I promised him I would
a long time ago.

58
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,559
Now, that's a pretty wild story,
Mr. Meiks.

59
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,271
I don't see what, if anything,
this has got to do with my case.

60
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,025
Adam is the God's Hand killer,
Agent Doyle.

61
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,320
He's the one you're looking for.

62
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:30,157
Did he tell you that before he asked you
to take him to Thurman?

63
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,953
- If that's the case, you left that part out.
- I haven't finished yet.

64
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,498
- Oh, there's more?
- A lot more.

65
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,501
Excuse me a minute.

66
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,765
Meat sheriff's office.

67
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,809
Can I talk to the sheriff there,
please?

68
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,645
This is Agent Wesley Doyle
of the FBI.

69
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,481
He's not in right now. May I help you?

70
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,359
Well, we got a man here in my office,
name of Fenton Meiks.

71
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,029
Fenton Meiks? What's he doing there?

72
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,699
- You know him?
- Well, yeah.

73
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,201
He caused a bit of a ruckus
here earlier.

74
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,038
He stole an ambulance
and his brother's body too.

75
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,252
Did my story check out?

76
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,672
Yeah, it did.

77
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,341
So am I under arrest now?

78
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,636
You damn sure should be.

79
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,723
Apparently the sheriff there
is willing to forgive and forget...

80
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,058
as long as you'll bring
that ambulance back.

81
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,145
Nobody wants to press any charges.

82
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,607
Well, you gotta love small towns.

83
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,694
Why would you go to all that trouble,
just walk in here and confess it to me?

84
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,072
I'm here because I can't live
with what I know anymore.

85
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,078
What exactly do you know?

86
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,042
That is your mother, isn't it?

87
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,502
- Yeah, it is.
- I knew it.

88
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,672
You got the same eyes.

89
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,591
Why don't we get back to your story?

90
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,679
What makes you think that your brother
is the God's Hand killer?

91
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,932
I know it was him.

92
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,434
How do you know?

93
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,063
He started back in Thurman.

94
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,777
It was near the summer of 1979.

95
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:04,353
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
Down in my heart

96
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,691
- You're supposed to say "where?"
- I don't wanna sing that dumb song.

97
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,943
You don't have to sing it.
Just say "where?"

98
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,611
All right. Where?

99
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,489
Not now.
I'll point to you when it's time.

100
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,826
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
Down in my heart

101
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,953
- Where?
- Down in my heart

102
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,997
- Where?
- Down in my heart

103
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,418
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
Down in my heart to stay

104
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,672
And if the devil doesn't like it
He can sit on a tack

105
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,008
Sit on a tack

106
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,342
Sit on a tack

107
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,347
And if the devil doesn't like it
He can sit on a tack to stay

108
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,641
So who was that chick that...?
Who threw up?

109
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,728
Oh, that was Katie Hagen.
She is sure pretty, though.

110
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,023
- That was real nasty, though.
- Oh, yeah.

111
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,776
All over the floor.
And when the principal fell?

112
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,696
I got the joy, joy...

113
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,033
We lived right behind
the Thurman public rose garden...

114
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,828
in the house where they used to
keep the gardeners back in the '50s.

115
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,790
Dad had gotten a good deal on it
back when he and Mom got married.

116
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:12,880
The unexpected incident that creates
those dangerous moments.

117
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,341
The ropes were suddenly
off the alligator.

118
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,552
Adam was 3 years younger
than me.

119
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,055
Our mom had died giving birth to him...

120
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,683
so I basically took care of him
ever since I can remember.

121
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,563
Our dad worked as a mechanic
over in Jupiter.

122
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,192
He usually got home around 5:30
and we'd all have dinner together.

123
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,027
Escape behavior of gators.

124
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,154
- Hey, kiddos.
- Hey, Dad.

125
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,947
Something sure smells good.

126
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:44,203
The next job was to get a rope
over his mouth to tie up...

127
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,540
- How was your day?
- It was all right.

128
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,376
Let's eat.

129
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,172
Whoa, there, tiger. Save some for us.

130
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,841
- I sure love peas.
- You must.

131
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,428
You better be careful, though.
You just might turn into one.

132
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,848
Say, how'd you do on that math test?

133
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,975
Barely passed.

134
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:11,355
Well, I was never any good
at math either.

135
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,732
I still can't do anything
without a calculator.

136
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,151
Yeah, but there's gonna be
another test next week.

137
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:20,155
- That one's gonna be even harder.
- Hey, don't sound so glum.

138
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,535
Tell you what.
We'll sit down this weekend...

139
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,287
see if we can't figure
out that junk together, okay?

140
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,331
All right.

141
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,586
Hey, Fenton, can we go see
Meatballs after school tomorrow?

142
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,755
We've already seen it.

143
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,424
I wanna see it again.

144
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,093
No, we're gonna go see The Warriors.

145
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,763
- Can't. It's rated R.
- We'll sneak in.

146
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,974
Teeth all brushed?

147
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,268
You sure about that, Adam?

148
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,520
All right, breath-test time.

149
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,607
Dad, I did brush them.

150
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,943
I'm just yolking with you, egghead.

151
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,113
Don't worry, Fenton. I know
you're too big for a good-night kiss.

152
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,576
- Good night, boys. Sleep tight.
- Don't let those bedbugs bite.

153
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,202
That's right.

154
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,496
- Love you guys.
- Love you too, Dad.

155
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,914
Night, Dad.

156
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,833
Good night, Curtis.

157
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,005
- I wanna see Meatballs again.
- Fine.

158
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:22,468
You can see Meatballs
and I'll see The Warriors.

159
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,012
But I don't like to watch movies
by myself.

160
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,222
Too bad.

161
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,141
Please?

162
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,643
Fine.

163
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,854
Fine. Just go to bed.

164
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,862
And that was our family.

165
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,156
Just the three of us.

166
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,408
All of Mom and Dad's relatives
had died off...

167
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,869
so there was no one left but us.

168
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,370
We didn't mind, though.

169
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,582
We didn't need anybody else.

170
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,709
We were happy together.

171
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,461
Until...

172
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,963
- Fenton, wake up.
- Dad?

173
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,299
- I've got something to tell you.
- What's wrong?

174
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,884
It's okay.

175
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,303
Adam, wake up and listen.

176
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,681
I need you both to listen to me
very carefully.

177
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,934
Something's happened.

178
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,272
He said he'd had a vision that night.

179
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,108
A vision from God.

180
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:50,180
An angel came to him
and told him the truth of this world...

181
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:55,269
and revealed God's special purpose
for our family.

182
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,564
The end of the world is coming.
It's near.

183
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,857
The angel showed me.

184
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,944
There are demons among us.

185
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,780
The devil has released them
for the final battle.

186
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,950
It's being fought right now.

187
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:14,580
But nobody knows it except us
and others like us.

188
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,957
I'm scared, Dad.

189
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,418
There's nothing to be afraid of, tiger.

190
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,796
We've been chosen by God.
He will protect us.

191
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,924
He's given us special jobs to do.

192
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,304
We don't fear these demons.
We destroy them.

193
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,308
We pick them up one by one
and we pitch them out of this world.

194
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,811
That's God's purpose for us.

195
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:42,190
- The angel called us God's hands.
- So we're like superheroes?

196
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,734
That's right.

197
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,154
We're a family of superheroes
that are gonna help save the world.

198
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:51,116
But, Dad, that doesn't make any sense.

199
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,245
I know it sounds that way, son,
but it's the truth.

200
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,956
So, what are our superpowers?

201
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,042
Well...

202
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,171
We can see the demons
while other people can't.

203
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,506
And the angel told me...

204
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,801
that God would be sending us
three weapons to destroy them with.

205
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,179
Magical weapons?

206
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,057
I imagine so.

207
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,184
When do we get them?

208
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,895
I don't know. The angel just said soon.

209
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:25,192
That's all I was told, except that we're not
supposed to tell anybody about any of this.

210
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,860
Absolutely no one.

211
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,947
If we do, we put them and ourselves
in danger.

212
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,243
Fenton...

213
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,788
don't worry, it's okay.

214
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,415
It's a lot to understand.

215
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,503
I wanted to wait to tell you till I had
the chance to figure it out myself...

216
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,006
but the angel said I had to do it now.

217
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,342
Fenton?

218
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,554
I didn't know what to say or how to feel.

219
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,890
Do you understand what I told you?

220
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,142
Judgment Day's here.

221
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,562
It was too messed up to understand
or even acknowledge.

222
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,940
Soon we'll all be in heaven.

223
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,234
You, me, Adam, with Mommy.

224
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,320
I didn't realize it at that moment,
at least not consciously...

225
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,738
She's waiting in heaven.

226
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,659
But my happy and mostly secure world
had just been flipped over...

227
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,536
and there were dark things there.

228
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,288
- Judgment Day is here.
- Very dark things.

229
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,748
We've been chosen by God.

230
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,043
And my little boy's mind
just couldn't take it.

231
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,845
Adam! Fenton!

232
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,850
Up and at them, boys!

233
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,193
Morning, kiddo.

234
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,572
Hey, come on, lazybones.
It's late. We overslept.

235
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,953
Well, let's go. Snap to it and get dressed.
I gotta get to work.

236
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,122
Drop you guys off on the way.

237
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,208
What's wrong with you?

238
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,630
Nothing.

239
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,733
Hey, let me have a bite of that.

240
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,528
None of us mentioned it.

241
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,615
It was only a dream, a nightmare.

242
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,162
Nothing that crazy could be real.

243
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,707
Everything was okay, just like before.

244
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,715
Well, have a good day at school, boys.

245
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,092
And remember not to tell anyone
what I told you.

246
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,512
We won't, Dad. Bye.

247
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,233
I want you all
to copy down this sentence.

248
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,196
We're gonna go through the structure.
The girl in...

249
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,698
the blue dress...

250
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,994
I refused to believe it.

251
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,665
That whole next week
was just a dream too.

252
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,753
Her brown dog.

253
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,383
Like when Dad started bringing home
the magical weapons.

254
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,345
He was on his way to work...

255
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,598
when God called to him.

256
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,187
Hold this. Be careful.

257
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,443
I still can't understand
what these gloves are for, though.

258
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,117
Just a long, long dream.

259
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:48,121
I want you to all write this down
at the top of your pages in big letters.

260
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,165
How about that spot over there?

261
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,043
Boys! Boys, look at this.

262
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,669
Come on, hurry up.

263
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,339
- Be careful.
- And stay where I can see you, dear.

264
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,467
- Let's go over here.
- You bring the basket.

265
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,594
We've got them all.

266
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,971
It won't be long now.

267
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,641
The angel came again last night
and told me...

268
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,977
that God'll be sending
us a list of the first seven demons soon.

269
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,189
It wasn't real. It couldn't be.

270
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,816
I just had to wait it out.

271
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,532
- Come over here a minute, Fenton.
- I'm washing dishes.

272
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,660
They can wait.

273
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,662
Come here, I wanna talk to you.

274
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,678
Well, I know you've had some trouble...

275
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,890
adjusting to everything
that's happened this week, and I'm sorry...

276
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:52,811
but God has willed this
and we must obey God.

277
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,231
Maybe you just dreamed it.

278
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,483
I didn't dream it.

279
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,778
I wouldn't make up
something like that, son.

280
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,240
Maybe...

281
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,913
Maybe you're not right in the head.

282
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,291
It happened, Fenton. It's true.

283
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,752
You'll see that soon.

284
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,463
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

285
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,216
I got the first list.

286
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,179
The angel came to him
while he was at work.

287
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:21,399
Joe to first window.
Joe to first window.

288
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:45,006
Dad, these are people's names.

289
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:50,678
That's right, and they'll look
like people too, but they're not.

290
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,934
The angel said
when I lay my hands on them...

291
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,645
I'll reveal them for
what they truly are.

292
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,563
That's what the gloves are for.

293
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,358
I get them and bring them back here
with the gloves on...

294
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:07,112
and once they're back here,
I take the gloves off and reveal them.

295
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,990
You'll see. Then you'll believe.

296
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,867
Anyone know what this word means?
You remember what this word means?

297
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,497
The dream had finally ended.

298
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,082
It was all real.

299
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,797
And I had to stop him.

300
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,802
The obvious answer was
to tell someone what he was planning...

301
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,512
but I couldn't do that.

302
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,683
I loved him, even if he had gone crazy.

303
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,102
Dad, look. I got a list too.

304
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,480
Where did you get this, Adam?

305
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,107
God gave it to me.

306
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,613
Isn't Travis Shed that boy that was
picking on you at school?

307
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,198
He's a demon.

308
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,618
Tell the truth, Adam.

309
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,912
You made this list up yourself,
didn't you?

310
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,665
- No, God did.
- Adam.

311
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,210
Come on. Right here.

312
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,505
Listen to me, son.

313
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,175
You can't just make stuff like that up.

314
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,719
We destroy demons.
If we were to use your list...

315
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:16,097
we wouldn't be destroying demons,
we'd be killing people.

316
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,308
And we can never do that.

317
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,393
Now, destroying demons
is a good thing.

318
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,730
Killing people is bad. You understand?

319
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,191
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- That's all right.

320
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,734
It's okay.

321
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,903
You just gotta have a little patience.

322
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,070
Don't worry.

323
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,740
God will send you your own list
when you're older.

324
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,492
Okay, go do some homework.

325
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,589
The only thing left to do was to tell.

326
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,764
But that was easier said than done.

327
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,867
Dad had promised to take us
to the movies that night.

328
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,163
But he didn't come home from work.

329
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,668
- When's Dad coming home?
- I don't know.

330
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,672
Think he's destroying a demon?

331
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,383
- It's all make-believe, Adam.
- No, it's not. It's true.

332
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,386
Listen to me.
None of that demon junk is real.

333
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,389
Daddy... He just made it up.

334
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,975
- No, he didn't.
- He did too.

335
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,310
Just like Santa Claus.

336
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,895
You remember last Christmas...

337
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:49,148
when you caught Dad putting
presents under the tree, don't you?

338
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,859
It's just like that.

339
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,363
Adam, have I ever lied to you?

340
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,742
All right, look.
Dad made up this whole thing.

341
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,787
Those names on Dad's list
are real people.

342
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:06,165
- Do you understand?
- But why would he make it up?

343
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,792
I don't know.

344
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,045
I think we should leave.

345
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,382
You mean run away?

346
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,719
Will you go with me?
Only for a little while.

347
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,764
- I don't wanna leave Dad.
- Neither do I.

348
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,642
But we might have to.

349
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,519
Why?

350
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,192
Dad's gonna kill somebody.

351
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,760
Son, come over here.

352
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,597
Come on. I need your help.

353
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,164
Dad?

354
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,375
Come on out here, Adam.

355
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,091
Shine that light over here.

356
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,012
Hey, Dad, who is that?

357
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,807
That's a demon, son.

358
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,187
Come on in here, boys. It's all right.

359
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,357
Go on. Don't be afraid.

360
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:59,881
God came to him earlier that day
and told him that the time had come.

361
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,844
After work, he drove down
to Jacksonville...

362
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:08,014
about 45 minutes or so
southwest of Thurman.

363
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:13,352
He said he'd never been there before,
but he had no problem finding it.

364
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,771
God was leading him.

365
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,387
- Cynthia Harbridge?
- Yes?

366
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,318
Dad, don't. Please don't.

367
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:07,240
Fenton, if I could spare you this, I would.

368
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,870
But we are God's servants
and his will must be served.

369
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,376
Don't be afraid, son.

370
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,734
Is that true?

371
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,404
Why would I make it up?

372
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,615
Where's your father now?

373
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,868
Dead.

374
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,081
Sir, I was just thinking
about heading out.

375
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,292
Unless you need me to stay.

376
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,252
No.

377
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,255
That's all right. You go ahead.

378
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,798
Well, have a good night, sir.

379
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,352
So he killed that woman
right there in front of you?

380
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,314
Yeah, but not to his way of thinking.

381
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:26,485
You see, to him, he hadn't killed a woman,
he had destroyed a demon.

382
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:32,992
He believed that when he laid
his hands on her, it revealed her sins.

383
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,593
Dad, don't! Please!

384
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,267
No, Adam.

385
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,148
Do it like this.

386
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,944
Gotta be done a certain way.

387
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,946
The angel was real specific.

388
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,615
Why out here in the rose garden?

389
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:41,662
God chose it,
just like he chose us, I suppose.

390
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,461
Don't cry for her, Fenton.
She wasn't human.

391
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:52,256
Didn't you see that
when I touched her?

392
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,300
I saw it, Dad.

393
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,056
You killed her.

394
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:06,103
I didn't kill her, son.
I destroyed her. She was a demon.

395
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,358
You know, I wasn't so sure
I could do it myself.

396
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,320
I mean,
she looked like a woman to me too.

397
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:19,909
But after I touched her,
all I could see was the evil.

398
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,077
And I had to do it.

399
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,457
I'm sorry you didn't see it too.

400
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,584
You will next time.

401
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,670
You're gonna do it again?

402
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,257
This is our job now, son.

403
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,510
You've got to accept that.

404
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,678
I won't let you.

405
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,223
You can't stop it.
We are doing God's work.

406
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,933
I'll tell.

407
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,020
If you do, someone will die.
The angel was clear on that.

408
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,271
Do you understand?

409
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,859
Answer me, Fenton.
Do you understand?

410
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,365
So you didn't tell?

411
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,493
No. I should've, but I was afraid.

412
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:06,205
I mean, I loved my father,
but I was terrified of him.

413
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:11,377
So now you understand why I know
my brother is the God's Hand killer?

414
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,672
Have you got any physical proof?

415
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,424
I read in the paper...

416
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,970
that only one of the bodies
of the six victims had been found.

417
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,221
Now, is that true?

418
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,140
You read it in the paper, didn't you?

419
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:29,436
- Doesn't necessarily mean it's true.
- Well, in this case it does.

420
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:33,440
See, the first victim
was found mutilated...

421
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,403
with a note saying
that God's hand had taken him.

422
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,823
But all the rest, only notes were found.
No bodies.

423
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,909
- How do you know they're dead?
- Well, we don't for sure.

424
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:48,998
But the first note told us we wouldn't
find any more bodies from then on.

425
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,250
Said...

426
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,586
he wanted to keep them.

427
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:58,382
I got a pretty good idea
where the rest of them bodies are.

428
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,010
The rose garden.

429
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,099
Now, why didn't you tell me that
in the first place?

430
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,726
Would you have believed me?

431
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,605
Come on.

432
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,122
Here.

433
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,293
What's this?

434
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,795
Put them on.

435
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,923
Or I'll put them on for you.

436
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,518
Let's go.

437
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,577
I got it.

438
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,769
So tell me something.

439
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,022
Why didn't you come see me sooner?

440
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,735
You wanna get on I-30 east up here.

441
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:47,449
I just can't imagine how you can keep
something like that inside for so long.

442
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,536
I guess I avoided it.

443
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,372
Because I wanted to.

444
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,464
You know,
you never did tell me why it is...

445
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:05,801
you keep just that one picture
of your mother in your office.

446
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:16,061
My mother was murdered a couple
of days after that picture was taken.

447
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:21,900
Butchered by some whacked-out killer
like your dad.

448
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,904
Did they ever catch him?

449
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,158
No.

450
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:32,369
Is that why you took this job?

451
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:37,207
You know, you're pretty good at this.
You ever think about becoming a cop?

452
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,212
Well, you know, when I was a kid.

453
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,216
Well, you got the instincts for it.

454
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,094
A cop's gotta have good instincts.

455
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:52,181
You know what mine
are telling me now?

456
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,101
You are hiding something from me.

457
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,272
What is it do you think I'm hiding?

458
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,902
Well, why don't you just keep talking?
Maybe I'll figure that out.

459
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,829
You okay, Dad?

460
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:20,751
I'm all right, son. Here I come.

461
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,673
Dad, why did God let this
happen to me?

462
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,551
Don't blame God, Davy.
It wasn't his fault.

463
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,261
God let me do it.

464
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,057
What God lets you do
is decide for yourself what you will do.

465
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,018
You're not a puppet
with strings tied to you.

466
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,478
No.

467
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,147
So God doesn't make you
do anything.

468
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:45,192
He wants you to decide for yourself.

469
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,238
After that night,
nothing much happened.

470
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:53,325
Dad didn't mention it any more.
Neither did Adam.

471
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,577
Once a full month had gone by...

472
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,247
I'd completely convinced myself
that it was over...

473
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,749
and everything was gonna be all right.

474
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,335
- Bye.
- See y'all later.

475
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,046
- See you.
- You see Dukes of Hazzard last night?

476
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,840
Remember when Daisy Duke
bent over?

477
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,717
I like Boss Hogg. He's funny.

478
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,263
Man, I'd do anything
to really see her tits.

479
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,974
- Oh, you said tits...
- Shut up, Adam.

480
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,935
You wanna spend the night tonight?
We can wrap Corey's house.

481
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,854
Sure, but I'm gonna have
to ask my dad.

482
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,939
Well, my mom can call
and ask if you want.

483
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,816
- Sure.
- I'll see you in a little bit.

484
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,694
- Bye.
- Hey, what's "wrap" mean?

485
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,321
Tell you later. Come on, I'll race you.

486
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,173
Come on.

487
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,759
No, I'm gonna go around on the road.

488
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,622
- Dad?
- In here.

489
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,168
- Whose van is that out there?
- Ours.

490
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,378
Ain't she a beaut?

491
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:34,051
Your friend's mom just called.
I told her not tonight.

492
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,429
We got some work to do
in the morning.

493
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,820
Dad told us that there were moments
in everyone's life...

494
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,447
when they could disappear...

495
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,158
without anyone knowing
where they went or why.

496
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,868
He said those were the moments...

497
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:03,121
when God's hands
could reach out and take you.

498
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,084
According to Dad, nothing,
not even a camera, could catch us.

499
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:10,462
We were invisible
when we were God's hands.

500
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,423
- What do we do now, Dad?
- We wait.

501
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,969
We'll get him when he comes out,
just like I told you, remember?

502
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,971
Fenton?

503
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,931
I can't do this, Dad.

504
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,976
- "Can't" never could do anything.
- I can do it, Dad.

505
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,311
You sure can, tiger.

506
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,315
- Well, what if someone sees us?
- They won't.

507
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,025
It's broad daylight.

508
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:35,153
I told you. God will blind them for us.

509
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,194
There he is, boys.

510
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,406
- Come on, Fenton.
- Dad, I can't.

511
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,034
Yes, you can. Now, move.

512
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,036
Do what I tell you.

513
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,045
Please, Trixie.

514
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,964
Trixie, come on. Come, Trixie.

515
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,884
- Trixie, come on.
- What are you doing, boy?

516
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:42,220
My dog. She... She's under your car.

517
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,057
Well, let's see.

518
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,357
Help me grab his legs.

519
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,068
Help me grab his legs. Now!

520
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,903
Come on!

521
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,159
Edward March?

522
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,163
You think that's an innocent man
there, don't you?

523
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,332
Well, it's not.

524
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,861
You didn't think anyone knew
about that, did you?

525
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,405
But God saw you.

526
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,615
- Dad, don't. Please.
- Quiet.

527
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,786
And you can't escape God's wrath.

528
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,808
Can't believe you still didn't see it.

529
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,769
He was a murderer
of little children, Fenton.

530
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,771
Babies.

531
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,986
Babies.

532
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,581
He's the murderer.

533
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,416
We've gotta get out of here, Adam.

534
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:37,878
- What do you mean?
- We've gotta run away.

535
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,505
Told you we might have to.

536
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,507
I don't wanna run away.

537
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:46,928
We have to.

538
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,597
Why?

539
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,850
Listen to me, Adam.

540
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,020
- Dad kills people.
- No, he doesn't.

541
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:56,271
He's a demon slayer.

542
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,523
That's all lies, Adam.

543
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,193
No, it's not.
I see it when he touches them.

544
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,072
No, you don't. Dad's brainwashed you.
It's all a big lie.

545
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,658
He's a murderer and you help him.

546
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:12,704
We're just serving God's will.
I'm telling Dad on you.

547
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,707
Adam... Adam! Adam!

548
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,275
Get up and get dressed.

549
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,694
And don't wake your brother.

550
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,084
Sit down.

551
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,509
Your brother told me
what you said last night.

552
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:14,766
I want you to know I've never
killed anything in my whole life.

553
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,602
That's a lie and you know it.

554
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,610
I did a lot of thinking and praying
after you went to bed.

555
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,282
I asked the angel to visit you.

556
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,785
But instead he visited me.

557
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,539
He told me something...

558
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,959
that I don't wanna believe.

559
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,963
What?

560
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,092
It doesn't matter.

561
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,554
Because together you and I
are gonna prove him wrong.

562
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,933
You just don't have any faith.

563
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,769
That's why you can't see the truth.

564
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:04,149
But we're gonna change that.

565
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,418
I want you to dig a hole right here.

566
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:30,008
Need to be about 10 feet deep
and 15 feet wide on both sides.

567
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:34,220
The length and the width
should form a perfect square.

568
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,266
- What?
- You heard me.

569
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,603
Why?

570
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:44,272
Because I'm your father
and you'll do what I tell you.

571
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,940
You understand?

572
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,401
Do you?

573
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:51,529
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

574
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,949
I expect half that to be dug by
the time I get home from work tonight.

575
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,161
- Dad, I can't do that.
- Pray.

576
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:20,308
I started digging that goddamn hole,
but I did not pray.

577
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,893
I would not.

578
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,063
I hated God. I despised him.

579
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:29,818
My hatred helped me dig,
kept me going.

580
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,238
Dad's or God's or the angel's
or whoever's plan it was...

581
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:34,572
would not work on me.

582
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,740
Hey, Fenton.

583
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,659
I knew what Dad was doing
was wrong...

584
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,245
and nothing was gonna change that.

585
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,247
Fenton?

586
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,918
I'm sorry I told on you.

587
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,636
You didn't tell him what I said
about running away, did you?

588
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,888
- No.
- Will you go with me, then?

589
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,599
- There's no reason to go.
- He's a killer.

590
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,435
No, he's not.

591
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,438
I've been praying for you.

592
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,274
- Have you been praying?
- Nope, and I'm not going to.

593
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:12,193
- But Dad said...
- I don't care what Dad said.

594
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,696
He might be able to make me
dig this stupid hole...

595
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:17,115
but he can't make me pray.

596
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,577
Just get out of here and leave me alone.

597
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,121
I'll help if you promise
you won't tell Dad.

598
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:24,372
I don't want your help.

599
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,125
- There's another shovel in the shed.
- Get out of here.

600
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,294
Butthole.

601
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,466
I wanted to run away, far away...

602
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,384
but I still couldn't leave Adam...

603
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:39,429
no matter how crazy
Dad was turning him.

604
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:43,641
Besides, there was nowhere to go.

605
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:07,540
All right, this time you are not...

606
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:11,044
This time, I'll make your lane.

607
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:14,631
All right, 21, 36...

608
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,847
- Finally gave up, huh, kiddo?
- I didn't give up.

609
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,683
- I'll be out there again in the morning.
- Hey, come on.

610
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,352
I didn't mean it like that.

611
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,354
I don't wanna fight with you, son.

612
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:34,818
I'm not doing this to hurt you.
Wish you could understand that.

613
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:41,115
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

614
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,034
- Let me see your hands.
- They're fine.

615
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,869
Let me see them.

616
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,999
- Didn't you wear gloves today?
- I didn't need them. I'm fine.

617
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,424
Here.

618
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,344
Help ease the pain.

619
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,722
I said I was fine.

620
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,977
I know you're mad, but that's no reason to
cause yourself pain. Now, you take those.

621
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,898
I got an extra pair of work gloves
in the shed.

622
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:16,484
I want you to use those from now on.

623
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:20,238
Won't do you any good
now that you've wrecked your hands...

624
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,740
but a couple of days, you'll be fine.

625
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,453
I want you to know I'm proud of you.

626
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,081
And I know God's proud of you too.

627
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,086
Take some time off
and let those blisters callous over.

628
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,714
Then you can get back to it, all right?

629
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,597
Well, good night, then.

630
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,391
Come on, tiger. Bedtime.

631
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,228
But Fenton gets to stay up.
Please, Dad?

632
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,063
Come on.

633
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,818
Brush your teeth.
I'll be in to say good night.

634
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,952
I kept digging.

635
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,080
My hands bled, but I wouldn't stop.

636
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:22,091
I kept at it morning, noon,
and night for 5 days.

637
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,928
And by the sixth day,
that hole was as dark and deep...

638
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,805
as my hatred for Dad's God.

639
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:31,476
Well, you finished it, all right.

640
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,772
Bet you didn't pray once
the whole time, did you?

641
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,398
Nope.

642
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,907
We started the cellar after that.

643
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,160
At least, that's what Dad called it.

644
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:51,329
But I knew better.

645
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:55,416
We were building a dungeon
down there.

646
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,421
We basically built a big wooden box
in the ground.

647
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:02,674
Good, boys. Get it over there.
Cover it good.

648
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,510
- But Dad said it would hold.
- Okay, ready? All right, good.

649
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:07,845
He said God would see to it.

650
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,765
Adam, get back here! Help me push!

651
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,685
Come on, keep it going. Push it.

652
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,689
Go! Go, Keep it moving!
Keep it moving!

653
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,827
You boys did good.

654
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:35,540
- Especially you, Fenton.
- No. I just did as I was told.

655
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:50,138
Let's give this a try. What do you think?

656
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,056
All right.

657
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,311
The next night,
he brought home another demon.

658
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,986
Get down here.

659
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:15,621
It has to be done. It's God's will.

660
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:18,583
Come on, do it like I showed you.
The neck first.

661
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,514
Fenton!

662
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,016
Fenton, get back here!

663
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,809
Boy!

664
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,103
Fenton!

665
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,781
I half expected angels
or even God himself...

666
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,492
to come out of the night and stop me.

667
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,244
But I had to do it.

668
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,371
It had to end.

669
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,135
- Hello?
- 10-34 to any and all units...

670
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,637
in the vicinity of Garden.

671
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:16,724
We have complaints of a 501 driving
on the alternate side of the street.

672
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,149
Hello? Hello?

673
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,155
Well, take it easy, boy.

674
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,491
Don't break my door down.

675
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,326
Well, what's your problem?

676
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,163
Craziest thing I've heard in a long time.

677
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,082
- What are you doing?
- Calling your dad.

678
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,333
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

679
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,252
Ought to be ashamed,
making up stories.

680
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,171
But it's true. I can show you.

681
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:54,679
Come on. Let's go.

682
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,194
All right.
It's around back, under the shed.

683
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,530
That's enough of that now, boy.

684
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,699
- Put an end to this. Come on.
- No, no, no.

685
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:17,034
I don't think you understand.
He's around back.

686
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:20,371
Let's see what your dad's
got to say about all this.

687
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,881
What's the trouble, sheriff?

688
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:35,219
Sorry to wake you, but your boy here
seems to have a problem.

689
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,143
Well, come on in.

690
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,115
I was about to lock up,
head over to Lake Thompson.

691
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,076
You know, get a jump on those bass.

692
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,538
And he comes running in
with this wild story.

693
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,498
Yep, it's quite a tale, all right.

694
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,876
It's the truth and you know it.

695
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:13,758
Makes me crazy to think that he
told everyone down at your office too.

696
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:16,093
Well, you can set your mind at ease
about that.

697
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,970
I was the only one there.

698
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,765
Of course, I don't believe a word of it.

699
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:25,853
What does get me, though, is why
would he make up such a crazy story?

700
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,234
I don't know why he made it up.

701
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:37,365
Probably did it to get back at me
for punishing him earlier.

702
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:40,618
- Did you tell him about that?
- He's lying.

703
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:42,787
Just check the shed.

704
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,958
I don't know what to do with him.

705
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:51,587
Well, they hit puberty,
seem to lose all respect for you.

706
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,757
Me and my boy survived it. You will too.

707
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:59,845
Just check the shed or the rose garden.
I could show you where they're buried.

708
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,391
Boy, why don't you just quit
all this nonsense?

709
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,768
Please, I can show you.

710
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:15,736
Maybe we ought to check
the shed just to quiet him down.

711
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,699
Well, if it has to be done,
it has to be done.

712
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,326
What do you think, kiddo?

713
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,998
Does it have to be done?

714
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:44,682
See?

715
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,352
Figured we ought to have a storm cellar.

716
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,812
Go on down, check it out.

717
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,232
Just watch your step.
I'm not much of a carpenter.

718
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,763
I don't see a thing.

719
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,474
He was here.

720
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,975
Boy?

721
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:32,021
You realize how much trouble you
could get into over a thing like this?

722
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:35,232
They must've moved him
because he was here.

723
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:39,487
Adam. Adam's got him somewhere.
I know it.

724
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:43,240
- I think I've seen enough.
- But...

725
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:46,202
I can show you where
the bodies are buried.

726
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,712
Please. You've gotta believe me.

727
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,745
May God welcome you...

728
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,873
and keep you.

729
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,979
I never killed a man before tonight.

730
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:56,730
I've seen you kill plenty.

731
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,400
Those were demons.

732
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:02,319
That was a man.
Why can't you see that?

733
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,779
You didn't have to kill him.

734
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:07,741
- I had to protect our mission.
- There is no mission.

735
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,327
That man is dead because of you.

736
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,621
You see him? Look at him.

737
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,666
Dead because you have no faith.

738
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,668
Do you understand
what you made me do?

739
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,796
- You made me commit murder.
- I didn't make you do anything.

740
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,756
You did. You're crazy.

741
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:27,511
Dad, no! Dad, don't!

742
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:41,108
It's all right, Dad. Don't cry.

743
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,760
Wait a minute, Fenton.

744
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,887
Go on inside, son.

745
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,223
I'll be there in a minute to tuck you in.

746
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,974
Go on. It's all right.

747
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,559
Go.

748
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,442
Come into the shed.

749
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,669
Come in and shut the door.

750
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:53,222
Are you afraid?

751
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:56,684
- Of what?
- You.

752
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,729
Only demons should fear me.

753
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,732
And you're not a demon, are you?

754
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,111
The angel said you were.

755
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:13,784
But I can't believe that. I won't.

756
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:21,750
You're my son,
and I love you more than my own life.

757
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:27,214
You know what's funny
about all this, Fenton?

758
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,719
I'm afraid of you.

759
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,493
Go on.

760
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,663
- But, Dad...
- Go on, get down there.

761
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,374
I don't wanna do this, Fenton,
but I have to.

762
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:06,670
I had to kill a man tonight.
I can't let that happen again.

763
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:10,799
- But, Dad, I promise I won't tell.
- I can't trust you.

764
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,718
I wish I could.

765
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:13,969
Now, go on.

766
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,513
But, Dad, I'm sorry.

767
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:22,019
I'm sorry too, Fenton,
but this has to be done.

768
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:25,773
Now, you get on down there
or I'll put you down there myself.

769
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,900
- But, Dad...
- Go!

770
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,235
No...

771
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,906
No. No.

772
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,075
No.

773
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,953
Dad, please. Dad. Dad, no.

774
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,538
Please.

775
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,207
No. Please, Dad.

776
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:45,459
You'll stay down here
until you see the truth.

777
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,711
Please, Dad. No. Please.

778
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,672
- Pray to God, Fenton.
- Please, Dad, no.

779
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,298
- Pray for a vision.
- Please. No.

780
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,550
- Only he can help you now.
- No!

781
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:58,055
Please don't do this, Dad. No, please.

782
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,057
Please, it's me, Fenton.

783
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:03,018
Please don't do this!

784
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:08,732
It's me, Fenton.
I'm not a demon. Please.

785
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,151
Please, please.

786
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,862
Please, no.

787
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:19,243
Please. Please.
Please, don't do this.

788
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:22,746
No! No! No!

789
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:25,416
Please, Dad.

790
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,100
Fenton?

791
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,769
Fenton.

792
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,648
Fenton, you all right?

793
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,109
Adam?

794
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,528
Adam, is that you?

795
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:00,743
Adam.

796
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,871
Adam, you gotta get me out of here.

797
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,122
I can't.

798
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:08,625
But I'm hungry
and I gotta go to the bathroom.

799
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,627
Dad won't let me feed you.

800
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,796
I brought you some water, though.

801
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:15,174
He says you can have a cup a day.

802
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,342
But I'll bring you more if I can.

803
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,345
Look, Adam. He's gonna kill me.

804
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,055
You've gotta get me out of here.

805
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,557
I can't.

806
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:26,477
Put your mouth to the knothole
right here.

807
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,898
You ready? Here.

808
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,702
You want some more,
or do you want me to save it for later?

809
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,413
More. More.

810
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:58,801
You've gotta get me out of here, Adam.

811
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,804
Dad says you'll probably be out
by the end of the week.

812
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,348
You just have to accept God's will.

813
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:07,351
A week? I can't stay in here that long.

814
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:09,394
I'll pray for you.

815
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:13,857
Adam? Adam! Adam!

816
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,533
Adam.

817
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:28,080
The days came and went.

818
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,459
I counted them by the cracks
of light through the hatch door...

819
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,128
and Adam's visits with the water.

820
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:39,174
I only slept when I passed out
from exhaustion.

821
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,218
What about your dad?

822
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:44,221
Didn't he ever come back
to at least check on you?

823
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,598
On the seventh day.

824
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,985
Has God spoken to you yet?

825
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:03,740
There is no God.

826
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,341
I lost count of the days after that.

827
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:23,760
It felt like weeks.

828
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:28,265
I finally went beyond fear
into total insanity.

829
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,977
I saw God.

830
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,771
He had finally sent me a vision.

831
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:39,276
It was then that I understood my destiny,
just like Dad said I would.

832
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:44,823
Dad, Fenton's not answering.

833
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,621
Fenton? Fenton?

834
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:06,762
Fenton. Fenton.

835
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:09,973
Boy. Come on, kiddo.

836
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,476
Get me that water.

837
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:19,441
Easy, boy. Easy.

838
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:20,901
Easy.

839
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:24,655
See? There you go, kiddo.
There you go, buddy.

840
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:25,948
Come on.

841
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,991
Dad?

842
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,577
I saw God.

843
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,624
Here.

844
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,876
Just try to take a little sip.

845
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,139
Hey, slow down there.
Don't wanna eat too fast.

846
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,516
You'll make yourself sick.

847
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:55,852
So did God tell you about the demons?

848
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,563
Sorry I ever doubted you, Dad.

849
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,858
I'm sorry too, son.

850
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:03,860
What did God look like?

851
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,946
Kind of hard to describe.

852
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:08,490
- Was he big?
- Adam.

853
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:12,828
Let your brother eat in peace.
He can't explain something like that.

854
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:16,039
- But I wanna know.
- Then maybe you should pray for it.

855
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:19,501
It's not fair. All I have seen are demons
and he gets to see God.

856
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,545
That's right.

857
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:24,256
But look at the price he paid.

858
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:28,218
That's all behind us now.

859
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:31,054
It's a new day, isn't it, Fenton?

860
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,391
So we gonna go get us
a demon now?

861
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,810
After a while.

862
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,895
When Fenton's ready.

863
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:48,071
A week later, I was ready.

864
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:52,993
My first demon was to be Brad White
from Dallas.

865
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,997
- There it is.
- I see it.

866
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,559
You sure you're ready for this?

867
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,978
Yes, sir.

868
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:26,735
I bought these for you.

869
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,946
You'll need them now
that God has spoken to you.

870
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,205
- All right. Let's go.
- I wanna go too, Dad.

871
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,123
Not this time, Adam.

872
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:42,292
You stay here. Keep your eyes peeled.

873
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:45,504
Don't worry. Your time will come.

874
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,217
Let's go.

875
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:26,795
Hey.

876
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,630
- Sorry to bother you...
- Yeah?

877
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,675
But my son and I,
we got a flat on our van.

878
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:33,969
Yeah.

879
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:37,848
Well, I was wondering if you had a tire
iron. We went off and left ours at home.

880
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,725
Hey, pal, what's with the gloves?

881
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:44,020
Oh, to change the tire.

882
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,064
- Don't wanna get your hands dirty.
- Yeah.

883
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:48,275
Brad, who is it?

884
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,861
Mind your business, you fucking bitch!

885
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,240
Goddamn women.

886
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:02,122
Yeah, I think I got one for you.

887
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:05,792
- Out back.
- Great.

888
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,882
Back here.

889
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,144
Let's see.

890
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:29,733
Here it is.

891
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,364
Shit.

892
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,580
Grab his legs.

893
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:14,527
Brad White?

894
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,204
You know, Fenton...

895
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:28,083
I've been waiting for this moment
ever since all this started.

896
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:34,339
I'm ready to fulfill my destiny.

897
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,218
I'm proud of you, son.

898
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:50,272
Fuck you!

899
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,148
You fuck!

900
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,276
Get the fuck out of here!

901
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,819
Get the fuck out of...

902
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,925
Destroy him.

903
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,832
Dad!

904
01:17:57,882 --> 01:18:00,342
Daddy, no. No.

905
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:03,428
No, Dad, no.

906
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:52,769
No!

907
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,870
We buried him in the rose garden.

908
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:19,170
We went to the sheriff's office
a week later and told them...

909
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:24,050
that Dad just didn't come home
one day.

910
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:30,473
They filed a missing persons,
but they didn't find anything.

911
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:36,771
After a while, they sent us
to separate orphanages.

912
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:41,484
So nobody ever knew about any of this?

913
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:43,319
No.

914
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,574
Not until now.

915
01:19:50,161 --> 01:19:52,328
What about Adam?
He didn't tell anybody?

916
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:02,505
Do you mind if we just sit here a while?
I don't much feel like talking anymore.

917
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,830
Tell me more about that promise
you made to your brother.

918
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:24,087
It was later on that night.

919
01:21:58,289 --> 01:21:59,789
Adam?

920
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:06,671
If you ever destroy me,
promise me you'll bury me here.

921
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:10,633
I promise to God I'll bury you here.

922
01:22:21,395 --> 01:22:23,146
I don't get it.

923
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:27,483
He promised you
that he'd bury you here.

924
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:29,110
Yeah.

925
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,653
If he killed you.

926
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:34,365
No, not killed. Destroyed.

927
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,701
Don't make any sense.

928
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:40,913
Yes, it does...

929
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:48,546
if the man standing in front of you
is Adam Meiks.

930
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,525
So you killed all those people.

931
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:15,406
No. No, I told you before,
I've never killed anyone in my life.

932
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,658
Fenton was the killer.

933
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:20,119
Just stop the bullshit
and tell me the truth.

934
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:22,538
You'll understand soon.

935
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:25,041
So let me show you
where I buried Fenton.

936
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:26,793
Hold it.

937
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,964
Take it real slow.

938
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,456
This is it.

939
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:10,336
This is the spot.

940
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:17,427
There's too many graves here.

941
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:20,221
There's only six victims.

942
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,769
Fenton didn't bury his victims here.

943
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:28,855
He kept them as trophies
in his basement.

944
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,068
This is where I put demons.

945
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,615
You thought your brother was a demon?

946
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:42,034
He was.

947
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:48,249
That's why he couldn't see the truth.

948
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,628
Dad knew it too.
He just couldn't accept it.

949
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:58,342
You see, God asked Dad
to destroy his son...

950
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:02,305
much like he asked Abraham
to sacrifice his son Isaac.

951
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:06,017
But Dad couldn't do it.

952
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:10,521
And God didn't take pity on Dad
like he did Abraham.

953
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:19,822
So he handed down the duty to me.

954
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,993
Fenton knew I'd come sooner or later.

955
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:27,121
That's why he left those notes,
to lure me in.

956
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:32,502
I guess he figured that when the killings
made the news, I'd come for him.

957
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:37,298
But I had to wait till God
put him on my list.

958
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:41,177
To come before that
would've been murder.

959
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:33,896
Adam?

960
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:52,039
Jesus Christ,
you really do believe all this stuff.

961
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,751
I've always believed.

962
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,049
It's all lies, Adam.

963
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,260
No, it's not.
I see it when he touches them.

964
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,260
You're just crazy as hell...

965
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:50,473
Fenton or Adam
or whatever your damn name is.

966
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,477
I don't really give a fuck.

967
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:58,981
All I need to know right now...

968
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:02,860
is you're a murdering son of a bitch.

969
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,071
And I got you.

970
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,074
Maybe.

971
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,578
But that's not gonna bring
your mother back, is it?

972
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,916
She's dead...

973
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:20,169
and her killer got away, didn't he?

974
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:25,675
Goddamn you, dirty little son of a...

975
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,158
How did you know?

976
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,661
You were on my list.

977
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:18,394
You didn't think anybody knew
about that, did you?

978
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,690
God knew. That's why he sent me.

979
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:51,135
I'm an FBI agent.

980
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:55,181
They'll come looking for me.

981
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:57,391
No, they won't.

982
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,228
They'll keep looking for Fenton.

983
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:05,107
You're gonna be his last victim.

984
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:09,195
They've seen you.

985
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,614
They'll know it was you.

986
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:24,293
God will protect me.

987
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:39,391
Just a couple units on the right side.

988
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,977
That's right. I want him found.
I want him found now.

989
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,980
I can't right now. I can't.
I'll get back to you.

990
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,607
- Here.
- Thank you.

991
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:47,858
I was here by myself.

992
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:50,611
Sure neither one of you
can remember what he looks like?

993
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,155
Look, I told you, it's just a blur.

994
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:56,492
I can't understand it.
I looked right at him. I shook his hand.

995
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,744
Hey, we've got a problem.

996
01:30:58,912 --> 01:31:01,288
Gotta take a look at this.

997
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,710
There he is.

998
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:09,797
We got you now, buddy.

999
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:12,716
- What is this?
- Can't explain it.

1000
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:15,136
All the tapes look like this.

1001
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,304
Goddamn it.

1002
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,349
We're running the name
he gave you now.

1003
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:23,686
- It's gotta be a fake name.
- Sounds fake.

1004
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:26,188
Fenton Meiks.

1005
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:29,358
Fenton Meiks, this is the FBI.
We're coming in.

1006
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:31,735
Go, go, go!

1007
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:38,742
- Clear.
- Clear.

1008
01:31:39,578 --> 01:31:41,078
Clear.

1009
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:43,539
Clear.

1010
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:50,921
- Anything?
- No.

1011
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:53,215
All right, let's dust it.

1012
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,389
Oh, my God.

1013
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,561
There's no one here, sir.

1014
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,480
We found this in the basement.

1015
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,571
Is he down there too?

1016
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:18,574
Not him.

1017
01:32:37,344 --> 01:32:38,761
Excuse me.

1018
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:41,305
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
How can I help you?

1019
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:43,766
I'm with the FBI.
I need to speak to the sheriff.

1020
01:32:43,934 --> 01:32:45,768
- Is he in?
- Sure thing.

1021
01:32:45,936 --> 01:32:47,478
Sheriff?

1022
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:49,939
Would you like some coffee?

1023
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,399
No, I'm fine, thanks.

1024
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:59,031
- Well, hey, Curtis.
- Afternoon, Becky.

1025
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:13,254
- Sheriff?
- Yeah.

1026
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:17,925
I'm Agent Griffin Hull of the FBI.

1027
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:20,928
I need to ask you some questions
about your brother.

1028
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:25,641
- Fenton?
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:31,272
Why don't you come on around back?

1030
01:33:38,655 --> 01:33:40,906
I appreciate you coming by
to tell me personally.

1031
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:43,909
I just wanted you to know
before we go public.

1032
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:48,080
Well, listen, if there's anything
I can do, don't hesitate to call.

1033
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:50,165
I think we got it covered from here.

1034
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,793
But if you can think
of where he might have gone...

1035
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,837
- ...or if he contacts you.
- Of course.

1036
01:33:55,005 --> 01:33:56,672
All right.

1037
01:33:59,968 --> 01:34:01,760
You're a good man, Agent Hull.

1038
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:42,634
